- Used grid on various elements throughout the Inhabitent website. 
Used a custom page template for the About Page. 

## Reflection 

- Learning WordPress has been a very challenging, but rewarding experience. In one week, I feel like I have learned a lot, but will definitely need to work on the project during portfolio week. 
- Here is a list of items I would like to improve: A few pages need to be styled, toggle-able search bar, incorporating more JS funcationality into the website, and working on my understanding of how everythings works together.
